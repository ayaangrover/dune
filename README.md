## What it is
Dune is a low profile hotswap wireless split keyboard with ZMK support. 

## Why I made it
I made it because I want to do my homework in my notebook but also be able to type and use my mouse. this way i can place my notebook between the two halves of my keyboard.

## Models
Case models are in /Case, case + pcb and just pcb models are both in /Dune.
