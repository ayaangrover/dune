## 10/3/2025 4 PM - Planned the project + budget  

![CleanShot 2025-10-03 at 16.13.06@2x.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjQ5LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--467912c7efaa3c3e1b62abae173f36995f9b51dd/CleanShot%202025-10-03%20at%2016.13.06%402x.png)

So here's my progress so far - it's a bit over the $100 mark but I'm hoping I can find some discounts or jlc coupons to bring the price down a bit(or even changing my shipping method)

using pcba for the diodes + on/off switch + battery connector

going to go and start the pcb now! using scottokeebs' library  

## 10/3/2025 9 PM - research + schematic  

spent a ton of time doing research to cut down the cost, but i only got a few bucks down. absolute waste of time...

then i spent time trying to find a nice!nano v2 footprint which includes the B+ and B- pins but couldnt. 

so i just did the switches and diodes. will do the mcu + connections once i get a symbol+footprint that work.

## 10/4/2025 2 PM - Finished the schematic  

![CleanShot 2025-10-04 at 14.14.11.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDIwLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--8682ed60050598894b618a13b11462d573148b61/CleanShot%202025-10-04%20at%2014.14.11.png)

finished schematic and dumped all the parts into the pcb editor and sent it to jlc for a price test, got a min of $50 AFTER a $15 discount...so now i'm $12 over the budget. 


anyway, im going to do the layout of the pcb and then routing, and also see where else i can save money  

## 10/4/2025 7 PM - Did the PCB Layout + 3D Models  

![CleanShot 2025-10-04 at 19.20.09.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDY4LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--2f2ecb2a25e24b893bb9f9ddfae153bee5c0d392/CleanShot%202025-10-04%20at%2019.20.09.png)

I FINISHED THE LAYOUTTTT!!! that took way too long but i eventually got smth i like, heavily inspired by the corne but it looks great to me. 

oh i also did all the 3d models, that took a while to position for each one

i put most of the stuff on the back so i can get it pcbaed if it fits in my budget

now i have to do the routing. might redo the layout if needed.

## 10/4/2025 10 PM - Routed half of the pcb and made a blueprint-style banner!  

![Dune.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDk2LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e9f7ebbc0e50f5891a869be9752b9feec0daf87a/Dune.png)


routed the left half of the keyboard!


also made a blueprint style banner thingy(inspired by kieran, followed his instructions to make it!)

i think it looks pretty cool, i imported the .step from kicad to onshape, made a drawing, exported as an svg, and fixed it up in figma. i might add some branding to the front or smth as soon as i get around to making a good branding  

## 10/20/2025 - worked on budgeting + edited pcb  

did research, knocked the price down to $100. covering $15 through my school and printing the keycaps.

took almost an hour of researching and asking to get the 15 accepted through maker club though...on the other hand im finally at $100 so i might get approved, only have the case left now!

also realigned some parts w/ issues in the pcb for a bit, it wasnt symmetrical and didnt match my finger length very well so i restaggered them. that part was pretty fun
