## 10/3/2025 - Planned the project + budget  

![CleanShot 2025-10-03 at 16.13.06@2x.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjQ5LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--467912c7efaa3c3e1b62abae173f36995f9b51dd/CleanShot%202025-10-03%20at%2016.13.06%402x.png)

So here's my progress so far - it's a bit over the $100 mark but I'm hoping I can find some discounts or jlc coupons to bring the price down a bit(or even changing my shipping method)

using pcba for the diodes + on/off switch + battery connector

going to go and start the pcb now! using scottokeebs' library  

## 10/4/2025 - research + schematic  

spent a ton of time doing research to cut down the cost, but i only got a few bucks down. absolute waste of time...

then i spent time trying to find a nice!nano v2 footprint which includes the B+ and B- pins but couldnt. 

so i just did the switches and diodes. will do the mcu + connections once i get a symbol+footprint that work.
